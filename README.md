## 📊 Project Overview

This Power BI Dashboard is designed for **AirPure Innovations**, a hypothetical company aiming to identify the most suitable Indian state to launch a new air purifier product. The goal is to **analyze air quality data and correlate it with health, population, and vehicle metrics** to drive data-informed market entry decisions.

## 📌 Key Objectives

- Identify states with the worst air quality trends.
- Understand how air pollution correlates with respiratory disease cases.
- Evaluate vehicle density and population as contributing factors to pollution.
- Recommend the best market to launch an air purifier product.

---

## 🗂️ Datasets Used

The analysis integrates multiple datasets:

1. **Air Quality Index (AQI)** — City-wise air quality over time.
2. **Disease Data** — State-wise respiratory disease case counts.
3. **Vehicle Registration** — Number of vehicles per state.
4. **Population** — Yearly population figures by state.

All datasets were cleaned, merged, and transformed to support holistic analysis.
